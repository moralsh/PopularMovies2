# PopularMovies stage II
Udacity's second project in Android Developers fast track

You must place a valid API KEY from TheMovieDB (https://www.themoviedb.org) in orther for this project to work, you should edit gradle.properties and add a propertie named MyTheMovieDBApiKey with the value of the api key.

You also need network and internet connection.

Hope you like it!
